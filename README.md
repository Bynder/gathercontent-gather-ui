# GatherContent UI Library

**Warning: This library is being sunsetted. There will be occasional updates for bug fixes and new components we require for legacy pages, but for the most part this is no longer being maintained.**
UI component library for all GatherContent components.

This uses [React Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/react-storybook) to showcase and host the development of the UI components used at GatherContent.

## Developing the library

1. Download the repository and run `npm run install`
2. Make changes to the components living on the `/lib` folder
3. Preview changes by running the live style guide, using `npm run storybook` and pointing your browser to `http://localhost:6006/`
4. Watch for file changes and rebuild with `npm run build:watch` (useful when you link your local version of `gather-ui` in the app)

## Linking the library

[You can use `npm link` to link your local version of this library to the `node_modules` in your app.](https://github.com/gathercontent/app/blob/master/webapp/README.md#linking-gather-content-ui)

For this to work, you also need to run `npm link react` in this repository.

## Running the test suite

Tests live under the `tests` folder and should be ran using `npm run test`.
To develop the components, a TDD runner is available by running `npm run tdd`

## Building for production

To build the components to be consumed by any application, both JavaScript and CSS files need to be generated.
Running `npm run build` will:

1. Generate ES5 compliant versions of each component in `/dist`
2. Generate a `.css` files containing all the concatenated component styles.
3. Copy over Sass configuration files to the `/dist`Â folder in order to be consumed externally.

## Using the library

The library is available on npm.

`npm install gather-content-ui`

Using the components is just like any other npm module. For e.g.:

```js
// Import the button component
import { Button } from 'gather-content-ui';

// Require once all the CSS directly from the node_modules folder
require('gather-ui/dist/styles.css');
```

## Publishing the library

The best and easiest way to publish this library to npm is to use our GitHub action.

1. Head on over to the actions tab
2. Select the "publish-npm" workflow
3. Click the "Run workflow" dropdown
4. Select a branch (this will just be main 99.99% of the time) and a version
5. Click "Run workflow"
6. Sit back and relax as the robots publish it for you! ðŸ¤–
